circuito.io
===========

* Circuito.io is a system for generating a circuit schematic & accompanying code samples.
Circuito.io generate the schematic & code based on your selection of micro-controller, i/o and power devices.

The circuito.io team is composed of Matan Harel, Eyal Mehoudar, Barak Yemini, Uri Ramot, Dor Tal, Pavel Tarnopolsky, Ofer Berman and Yana Segalis.

How to read this repository
---------------------------
You are here because you ised circuito.io and asked for a circuit and code sample for your project.
This is your project folder, you'll find here:
* bom.txt - all the parts used in designing the circuit - your chosen parts & any additionals that may be required for the circuit to work.
* firmware folder - includes all code need to operate the i/o devices using the micro-controller. firmware.ino is the main logic file.
* PCB folder - where you'll find the schematic diagram and breadboards view as a Fritzing file, and as two png files.
